Welcome to my SQL version of Amazon!

* To make this application I used a database I made in DBeaver through mySql. It is connected to MAMP to run.

* This application runs in the terminal, or command line, so I've provided some gifs below to demonstrate how the application runs! 

## Step One
* Once we begin the application, the user is shown a table (created in sql) and is prompted to choose an item from the list provided by typing in the unique ID of that item.

## Step Two
* Next, the user is then asked "How many of these items would you like to buy?" and to provide a numeric answer.

## Step Three
* The user decides whether or not to continue and buy more things or to exit. If they choose to stay, they are to run through the application again, if they choose to leave, they are prompted "Thanks! See you again soon."
