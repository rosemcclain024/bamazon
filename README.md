Welcome to my SQL version of Amazon!

* To make this application I used a database I made in DBeaver through mySql. It is connected to MAMP to run.

*This application runs in the terminal, or command line, so I've provided some gifs below to demonstrate how the application runs! 

## Step One
* Once we begin the application, the user is shown a table (created in sql) and is prompted to choose an item from the list provided by typing in the unique ID of that item.

## Step Two
* Next, the user is then asked "How many of these items would you like to buy?" and to provide a numeric answer.
